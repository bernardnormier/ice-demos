This demo is the Ice hello world demo.

The Ice extension for Ruby currently supports only client-side
functionality, therefore you must use a server from any other language
mapping.

After starting the server, run the Ruby client:

      ruby Client.rb

The client uses IceDiscovery to enable the location of the Ice hello
object. See the `config.client` file for details on the IceDiscovery
configuration.
