The interleaved demo is a variant of the throughput demo that
uses asynchronous requests to send "echo" requests to the server.
This way, the client sends multiple concurrent requests and we
maximize the bandwidth usage.

To run the demo, first start the server:

      server

In a separate window, start the client:

      client

See the throughput demo for a description of the metadata
used in Throughput.ice.
