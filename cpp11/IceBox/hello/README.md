To run this demo, open two terminal windows. In the first window,
start the IceBox server:

```
      icebox++11 --Ice.Config=config.icebox
```

In the second window, run the client:
```
      client
```

To shut down IceBox, use `iceboxadmin`:
```
      iceboxadmin --Ice.Config=config.admin shutdown
```
